Example: java -jar Aex.jar '/home/User/AndroidSdk/platform-tools/' '/home/User/apks/'

# Requirements
* Rooted Android 8.1

# Planned Features
* Support Android 6 onwards
* Implement option to install all apks in folder (2nd option from the menu)

# Why are you doing this?
Quick automated way to save all my apps before flashing a new ROM. I don't use Gapps so Google Play sync isn't an option for me.

# Wtf is up with that name.
Android Apk Extractor => Android Extrapktor. Get it? I'm incredibly unfunny. Almost as bad as a coder.

# License

All MIT license and stuff. I doubt anyone will have the exact specific case use I had but if you're crazy enough to use this piece of crap code, go wild. It's yours. I don't want it, that's why I'm sharing it.
